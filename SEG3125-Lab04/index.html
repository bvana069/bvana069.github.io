Patients referred to our doctors are not only those with a confirmed diagnosis, but also those suspected to have cancer. The costs for diagnosis, extensive health checks, and curative or palliative treatments vary according to the animal and their condition. Surgery, radiation therapy (in Montreal or Guelph), or low-dose chemotherapy will be recommended depending on the condition of the animal.
					<br><br>The decision to treat or not is always made by the owner with the assistance of the medical team, after receiving the most detailed and precise information possible. In most cases, several treatment options exist; however, when a curative option is not possible, a palliative alternative is provided. The main criterion in this decision-making process is always the patient’s quality of life.
